# [Project 1: Customer Segmentation ](https://github.com/BeatrizChumbinho/customer_segmentationWWW)

*Problem type:* Customer Segmentation / Clustering

## General Context

Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new
customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers.
Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of
customers that have different product interests, different market
participation, or different response to marketing efforts.

Market segmentation, the process of identifying customersâ€™ groups, makes use
of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of
customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments,
organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product
definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.
